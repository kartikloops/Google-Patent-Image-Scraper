# Google Patents Image Scraper

## Introduction

The Google Patents Image Scraper is a versatile Python tool that automates the downloading of patent images from Google Patents. Designed to support both GUI and non-GUI interactions within a single application, it caters to a wide range of users, from those who prefer a visual interface to those who need the efficiency of command-line execution.

## Features

- **Unified GUI and Non-GUI Functionality**: Seamlessly switch between a Graphical User Interface and a Command-Line Interface within the same application.
- **Robust Error Handling**: The tool is equipped with error handling to manage and retry after exceptions, ensuring reliability and stability.
- **Progress Summary Generation**: After completion, the tool generates a summary of the scraping session, detailing the number of images successfully downloaded, any skipped or failed attempts, and other relevant metrics.

## How It Works

The tool works in the following way:

1. Upon launch, users can choose to operate in GUI mode or proceed with non-GUI mode.
2. The scraper navigates to Google Patents, searches for specified patents, and retrieves image URLs.
3. Images are then downloaded and saved to a specified directory.
4. Throughout the scraping process, progress updates are displayed, either within the GUI or in the command line.
5. A summary report is provided at the end, summarizing the session's outcomes.
